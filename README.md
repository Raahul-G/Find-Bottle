# Find Bottle 
**Find Bottle** is an object detection model that uses YOLOv5, a popular deep learning-based object detection algorithm, and is deployed using Streamlit, a user-friendly Python web framework for creating interactive web applications. The goal of this project is to detect and locate bottles in images or real-time video streams.

## Installation
